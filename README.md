# GPU Particles v2
Version 2 of my GPU Particle System for [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)

## What's new?
- Completely rewritten
- Cleaner code
- Better UI
- Handles in Scene View
- Custom Meshes as particles (3D Particles!)
- Effectors (Magnets)

## Some things still don't work.
- UVs of particle Meshes are messed up
- Rendering or Emission problem: not all particles are visible
- Noise isn't implemented yet
- Size evolution should interpolate bewteen steps

## I need your help!
Unfortunately I don't have enough time to fix all of the remaining problems myself (at the moment).
If you are into Unity, Compute shaders and/or C#, feel free to create Issues and Pull requests.
I would love to collaborate with you!

## Compatability
- You won't be able to simply replace v1 with v2, sorry.
- Made using Unity 2017.3.1f1, might work with older versions
- Requires Compute Shaders to work. [These platforms are supported.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ComputeShaders.html)
